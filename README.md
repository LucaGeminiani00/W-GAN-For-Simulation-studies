# W-GAN-For-Simulation-studies
This repository proposes a PyTorch implementation of W-GAN with Penalized Gradients (Gulrajani et al.) for generating artificial cross-sectional data. Code can be easily run on CPU concerning LDW-E, whilst a GPU (easy implementation in Colab) should be used in case of LDW-CPS and LDW-PSID
